Harold spends three hours every day tracking his stocks this way, writing down the stock's original price (from the day before), current price, and the percentage of increase/decrease. You know that if this calculation were automated, Harold could streamline his daily process and spend more time making investment decisions. Your newly acquired Python skills can help you achieve this for him.\n",
